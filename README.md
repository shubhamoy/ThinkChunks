The idea to build ThinkChunks came after reading [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days](https://www.thesprintbook.com/book) by [Jake Knapp](https://jakeknapp.com/sprint), [John Zeratsky](https://www.johnzeratsky.com/), and [Braden Kowitz](https://kowitz.co/). However, it became possible with Generative AI to get the final output.
